# Echo
SJSU - CS151 assignment where you build a client-server app that echoes messages and can be expanded with subclasses and proxies.

Completeded in 5 stages:

Lab 1: Completed the Echo server and client, allowing clients to send requests (text) and reveive direct echoed responses.

Lab 2: Extended the server with a MathHandler that performs arithmetic operations (add, mul, sub, div) sent by clients.

Lab 3: Introduced a ProxyHandler and ProxyServer that forward client requests to the real server, enabling proxy-based architectures.

Lab 4: Created a CacheHandler, a smart proxy that caches previous requests and responses to reduce server load and improve performance.

Lab 5: Developed a SecurityHandler, a proxy that enforces user authentication by requiring clients to create accounts and log in before sending other requests.
